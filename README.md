## About

Anybody who has played the Borderlands series of games knows how important golden keys are. One golden key gets you an unlock of a top tier loot chest. The Borderlands developers often post SHiFT codes granting users free golden keys on Twitter. These codes typically expire within a week and if you are an infrequent Twitter user such as myself it is easy to miss them.

The idea behind this project is an automated script that will run every 'x' amount of time to get the developers most recent set of tweets. When the program detects a SHiFT code giveaway it will automatically send a text message to your phone letting you know right away.

The code is currently running on my Raspberry Pi 3b+ every 3 hours.

## Use

The code requires a lot of different API tokens and other personal information. I have omitted these from the file here on Github for obvious reasons. Therefore, this project is more a proof of concept than something anybody can grab and use. If this project really tickles your fancy, shoot me an email at: hriewe12@gmail.com and we can discuss personal usage.
